        <article>
            <p>Born in London, I spent my formative years from the age of 7 in Singapore before returning to London at
                the age of 12. Exposure to different cultures and dealing with change throughout my unique journey has
                greatly broadened my perspective and opened my mind to new ideas and experiences. When it comes to the
                professional sphere, I pride myself on my persistent focus and efficiency with tasks that need to get
                done. Effective communication is an integral part of who I am and how I approach my work, and I firmly
                believe that clear and transparent communication leads to a productive work environment. I am adept at
                articulating my ideas, actively listening to others, and engaging in constructive dialogue, which
                overall not only allows me to convey my thoughts effectively, but also enhances teamwork and overall
                productivity. Through growth and progress in my career, I remain committed to upholding the values
                necessary for a successful contribution to a dynamic workplace – integrity, dedication, and continuous
                improvement.</p>
            <p>I am currently studying software engineering at Nottingham Trent University.</p>
